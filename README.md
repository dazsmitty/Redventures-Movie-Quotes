# Redventures-Movie-Quotes

###Approach
The idea behind our project is to recommend movies to a user based on their feedback to a quote.

Initially the user will see a random quote from a random movie on the screen. The app will then ask if the user has seen this quote before. 
- If `yes` we will know that the user has seen the movie which means that we shouldnt recommend that movie to them. We will then start the process over with a new quote.

- If `no` we will know that user has not seen the movie before
	- We will then ask if the user likes the quote
		- If `yes` we will recommend the movie that the quote is from
		- If `no` we will start the entire process over with a new quote

Our group has zero experience utililizing APIs and making webaps around external data. That will present the largest challenge moving forward.
